This app is a demo for Startup Weekend Euro Seattle 2015.

This app is running on Swift 1.0 and will probably never be updated. It was simply an app for presentation of an idea of a startup.

The idea is that people are busy but they also don't like eating out a lot. There are a lot of people who like cooking
and because of this, we've decided to create a service to connect aspiring or professional chefs to those wanting a home-cooked
meal. We simply used Parse to save the data from posting a meal, and used a UITableView to display all the current listing.
This was my first project outside of school, and even though the entire premise of the startup was illegal due to food safety laws,
it was a pretty fun weekend.

Not sure why I made the ReadMe a blog post, but w/e.
